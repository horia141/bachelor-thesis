+ change all test modules to use 8'bxxxxxxxx instead of 8'h00 in cases where the value
  of the immediate constant for a instruction doesn't matter.

+ change inst_wen to inst_en.

* investigate relationship between next and n_Address and c_Address in Seq.

x add proper tests for Rom16x12.

* add proper error handling in SeqAsm
  * check all instructions are valid
  * check modules fit in memory

* add proper source string information to SeqSourceInfo by way of (take (length sourceInit - length sourceLast) sourceInit)

* remove evalExpr from exports and imports where it shouldn't belong.

* if it's beginning to be an issue, change the underlying generated type from String, to
 (String,Integer) or something similar. The String is still the generated value, but the Integer
 is used for calculations.

* see issues with negative numbers in SeqAsm.

: the gimp can output .c or .h files with the contents of an image.
